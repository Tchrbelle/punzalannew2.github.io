        <h1> My Testimonial </h1>
        <p> As a Community ALS Implementer in my respected district who is especially teaching the Digital Citizenship learning strand, 
            I should be knowledgeble enough to teach my students to armed them of the skills they need to develop for them apply in the near future.
            Having this oppurtunity to be trained here in Northern Bukidnon State College in 8 Saturday's is a great privilage for us to hone our 
            prior knowledge and able to gain new learnings during these sessions. During the training we've talked about these topics; the basic parts of the Computer, 
            the Microsoft Excel, the Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation and us, creating our own HTML. During these topics I've faced challenges that later on was 
            solve through the help of my co-Implementers and our Instructors. My overall experience during this training was very good. 
            I've learned new learnings and able to enchance my skills that is for sure I could use and apply on our lessons in our CLC.
            The Instructors knew the subject matter they are discussing, not just that they are also approchable and helpful. 
            The learning environment was also good, the quality of the food was good too. Thank you, NBSC and IT Department for this oppurtunity.   </p>
